## experimenting

Indexeddb is the standard database storage inside the browser. It is not Sql. It is a document database.  
It is more or less a key-value storage, but the value can be a javascript object and that can be complex.  
The api is in javascript, uses old fashioned callbacks and events, completely async, without async/await or Promises.  
How to use it efficiently from rust? This is the question.  
In this project I only experiment with indexeddb. In my next project <https://github.com/bestia-dev/pwa_currency_converter> I actually use this findings for something useful.  

## Development

In Visual Studio Code press `ctrl+j` to open the Terminal window. Use `cargo make` to see the prepared steps for deployment like:  
`$ cargo make release`  
And then follow the instructions on the screen like:  

- Run the web server in a separate terminal: cd ~/rustprojects/indexeddb_from_rust/web_server_folder/;basic-http-server  
- Run the web app in your browser: <http://127.0.0.1:4000/indexeddb_from_rust/>  

Oh, today I did everything right, but the browser said "This site can't be reached". After many attempts I discovered, that WSL2 `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` connection to Win10 is broken after putting the laptop to sleep. I have to restart the WSL in PowerShell Run as administrator with  
`Get-Service LxssManager | Restart-Service`.  
Not nice and very difficult to discover because WSL2 is running just fine, except this.  

In the browser (chrome, edge, firefox) use F12 developer tools to easily see the content of indexeddb in F12. Very convenient.  

## plantuml diagrams

I will give a try to make diagrams for documentation with `plantuml`. Diagrams are defined using a simple and intuitive language.  
It follows the philosophy "everything as code". So it can be easily embedded in the code or documentation.  
The diagram can be created online on <http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/umla/SoWkIImgAStDuNBAJrBGjLDmpCbCJbMmKiX8pSd9vt98pKi1IW80>  
Then it can be exported as svg and included as an image.  
The cargo-auto contains the automation task to create the svg image and embed it inside the README.md adding the markers.



## indexeddb, idb, idbr

The original api for `indexeddb`is too hard and very old-fashioned without async/await.  
I will use the [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) javascript library that makes `indexeddb` easier to use.
Javascript has changed over time. Javascript is now in ES2020 edition.  
I will make a typescript/javascript module to export functions from `idb`. Then one rust module to import functions from idb_export.
The rust library `idbr` will use the imported functions and create rust objects/structs and methods/functions.  
My rust code will then use only the `idbr` crate and hopefully there will be no more JsValue or other javascript peculiarities.

[comment]: # (auto_plantuml start)

```plantuml
@startuml
[rust code] ..> [idbr]
[idbr] ..> [idbr_imports]
[idbr_imports] ..> [idb_exports]
[idb_exports] ..> [idb]
[idb] ..> [indexeddb]

note right of (rust code): with async/await without jsValue
note right of (idbr): rust library for indexeddb
note right of (idb): javascript library with async/await\nfrom jakearchibald
note right of (indexeddb): supported by all major browsers\nbut no support for async/await

## Typescript adventure

For my only module in javascript `idb_export`, I will rather use Typescript. I will write some typescript code, transpile it to javascript and invoke that from rust.  
In runtime my code will use only the javascript file. Typescript is used only in development.  
The Typescript compiler must be installed with `npm` that is a part of `nodejs`. I must first install `nodejs`.  
On Debian the package `sudo apt install nodejs` is old version 10. The recommended version is 14, but it is from another package source.  
nodesource.com is providing a script to add the new package source and install `nodejs`.  
This is the commands:  

```bash
cd ~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
nano nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
node -v
npm -v
sudo apt install build-essential
```

Now I can install Typescript:  

```bash
npm install -g typescript
tsc --version
tsc --help
```

In the terminal I just use `tsc` to transpile my source code with settings from `tsconfig.json`.  
I added this to my `cargo make` for easy developing.  
The typescript file is inside the `src` folder like rust source code files.  
The resulting javascript file is stored in the `js` folder of the web app folder.  

## typescript/javascript imports

I had major problems with `import` statements.  
I tried first with `npm install --save idb`. It saves the files in a separate `node_modules` folder. That didn't work nice with my `import` statements. I don't know why.  
At last I decided to create `idb` as a separate folder and copy the `node_modules/idb/build/esm`.  
I needed to play with `tsconfig.json` to make it work.  
I added the keys: baseUrl, rootDir, outDir, esModuleInterop and most important path.  
From one side this import paths are just like folder structure, from the other side they are like url paths.  
Confusing. But after a long experimentation I made it work. I hope I don't need ever to change this settings.  

## code flow

The browser opens `index.html`.  
There it runs `import init from "./pkg/indexeddb_from_rust.js";`  
and `init("./pkg/indexeddb_from_rust_bg.wasm");`  
This is the wasm code compiled from `lib.rs` and wasm-bindgen creates the magic to start the designated function.  
The `idb_exports.js` is the result of typescript transpilation of `idb_exports.ts`, my only typescript module.
Inside that module I need to import the `idb` module with:  
`import * as idb from '/indexeddb_from_rust/idb/index.js';`
Then Rust code `idbr_imports_mod.rs` imports the `idb_exports.js` javascript module and functions.  
From here on we are now in pure (more or less) rust code.  

## missing unsafe

When importing javascript functions with `#[wasm_bindgen]` and `extern "C"`, the rust-analyzer shows a warning about `missing unsafe`. This is not correct, the rustc compiler compile it just fine. It is because the attribute macro wasm_bindgen uses magic and makes it safe. But rust-analyzer (for now) cannot understand attribute macros.  
For those looking to disable the missing-unsafe rule until it's fixed and are using VS Code, adding the following to your settings.json and reloading your editor will suppress these errors:

```config
"rust-analyzer.diagnostics.disabled": [
    "missing-unsafe"
]
```

## extern "C" - importing javascript functions

Javascript functions are imported using the `extern "C"` block.  
For now `rustfmt` has a bug that removes the word async, because here we have javascript functions and not C functions.  
The workaround is to add `rustfmt::skip`:  

```rust
#[rustfmt::skip]
#[wasm_bindgen(raw_module = "/indexeddb_from_rust/js/idb_exports.js")]
extern "C" {
    fn check_browser_capability();
    #[wasm_bindgen(catch)]
    fn init_db() -> Result<(), JsValue>;
    #[wasm_bindgen(catch)]
    fn add_key_value(store: String, key: String, value: String) -> Result<(), JsValue>;
}
```

For a javascript function with no return value is simple:  
`pub(crate) fn check_browser_capability();`  
A javascript async function can return one JSValue.  
`pub(crate) async fn get_key_value(key: String, ) -> JsValue;`  
If we want to catch errors in the Promise, add attribute `wasm_bindgen(catch)`, then the functions returns `Result<JsValue, JsValue>`:  

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen(catch)]
pub(crate) async fn init_db() -> Result<JsValue, JsValue>;
```

The imported async fn needs to be await just like rust functions. The macro wasm_bindgen makes some magic to transform Promises to futures on import:  
`let currdb = open_db().await.unwrap();`  
Some of the functions are async and others are not. It can lead to strange problems if an async function is used as a normal function. This is a thing to be careful about. Rust will hopefully show a warning, but javascript will not.  

## Currency exchange rates

I will get the daily exchange rate in json format from:  
<http://www.floatrates.com/daily/eur.json>  
and fill it into indexeddb.  

## pages

This PWA will have more pages. Pages are complete static html files inside tha pages folder. They use the same css as index.html.  
It is easy to edit and preview pages because they are complete.  
The rust code will fetch the html, extract only the body content and set_inner_html to div_for_wasm_html_injecting.  
A page is a template, and some placeholders will be replaced with data.  

## serde-wasm-bindgen

The indexeddb is key-value. Key is a string and value is any javascript object.  
That is really practical for javascript, but not so for rust.  
I will use [serde-wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/cloudflare/serde-wasm-bindgen) to work directly with javascript values from rust, because indexeddb stores javascript objects.  
From Rust to javascript:  
`serde_wasm_bindgen::to_value(&some_supported_rust_value)`  
From javascript to rust:  
`let value: SomeSupportedRustType = serde_wasm_bindgen::from_value(value)?;`  

## idbr rust functions

### init_upgrade_db

First of all the db must be initialized and upgraded.  
`idbr_mod::Database::init_upgrade_db("currdb", 2, &rust_closure_for_upgrade).await;`  
When the version is greater that the existing db version, it calls the rust closure.  
The closure looks like this:  

```rust
let rust_closure_for_upgrade = Closure::wrap(Box::new(
        move |db: JsValue, old_version: JsValue, new_version: JsValue, transaction: JsValue| {
            upgrade_currdb(db, old_version, new_version, transaction);
        },
    )
```  

We create a new store with: `db.create_object_store("Currency");`.  
To add/modify data in the store we must the given use the `Transaction` in mode `versionchange`.  
First we define the object store and then put the data:  
`let cfg = tx.get_object_store("Config");`  
`cfg.put("base_currency", "EUR");`  

### modify one data with implicit transaction

```rust
let db = idb::Database::use_db("currdb").await;
db.put_key_value("store", "key", "value").await.unwrap();
```

### modify many data in one transaction

```rust
let db = idb::Database::use_db("currdb").await;
let tx = db.transaction();
let store = tx.get_object_store_readwrite("Currency");
store.put("a", "a");
store.put("b", "b");
store.put("c", "c");
tx.close();
```
